###Fee & Workflow Proposal		

OpeningDesign has a preferred and unique way of working.  Although our http://openingdesign.com/about/ page provides more detail, in a nutshell, most of our projects are [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and are conducted [out-in-the-open](http://openingdesign.com/about/).

Simply put, this way of working allows us to be more efficient—ultimately bringing more value to our clients.  Having said that, we understand some clients may have hesitations regarding this approach.

To address your (XXX's/xxx's) potential concerns, if any, we would like to propose the following workflow and fee options:

* **Approach (A): A Fully Open Approach**—where the construction documentation, location, and the parties involved (XXX/xxx) are known and are shared publicly.  All newly created documentation is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
* **Approach (B): An Anonymous Open Approach**—where all newly created documentation is shared publicly and is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), however, the location and the parties involved are kept anonymous. 
* **Approach (C): A Fully Closed Approach**—where all documentation and parties involved remain confidential and private.

*(Please note, no matter the approach used, any previous documentation from parties outside this contract will not be shared publicly)*

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

####Fee Proposal Options: Hourly rates with a not-to-exceed fee

|-|Approach (A)|Approach (B)|Approach (C)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Arch. Level 1|$70/HR|$80/HR|$90/HR|
|Arch. Level 2| $60/HR|$70/HR|$80/HR|
|---| ---|
|Not-to-exceed Fee| $4,500|$5,800|$6,800|

We understand this is a unique approach and would be happy to have a face to face meeting to address any further questions you may have.  We have discussed this approach with xxx on previous projects, as well.
