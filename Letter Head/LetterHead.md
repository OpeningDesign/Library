#### Re: Request for an exception to 10.04(5)(b): Re-grading within 5ft of the property line.

**Property Address:**
3196 Aalseth Ln
Stoughton, WI 53589

Dear DCLWRD,
  
One of the project issues in building a house on Aalseth Lane is to address the structural problems on that road. Currently, a storm water runoff, south of the site, is inadequate as it causes water damage to a number of residents on Aalseth Lane. This includes the Proposed Project lot and both adjacent neighbors. In order to eliminate this problem an exception to the topography regulation is requested. 

The request is to install a combination of berms and swales to direct the storm water away from all three residents. Changes to the topography will start at the neighbor's lot line and extend to the new house. There will be no changes or construction on the adjacent properties. 

The need for this variance is promulgated by the existing lot size--being only 55 feet wide leaves little room to fit a house of today's standards and meet all of the easement and setback requirements.

Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely,
