				 - 1st priority: Material Tags
				 - 2nd priority: "OD_Keynote_Text Only" generic annotation
				 - 3rd priority: dumb text
		 2. Detail Lines and Detail Items. 
			 - Use 3D objects as much as possible
		 3. override graphics view by element
			 - use Visibility/Graphic Overrides for Categories instead, or better yet, use View Templates
