#### In-the-Open

All of [OpeningDesign's](http://openingdesign.com/) projects are conducted out-in-the-open.  That is, during the development of any one project, all the content is hosted publicly on either [Github](https://github.com/OpeningDesign) or [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/OpeningDesign) and is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source).  All team communication is conducted through public [Riot.im](http://openingdesign.com/communication/) chat rooms.



Our [about page](http://openingdesign.com/about/) provides a more nuanced description of this open approach.
