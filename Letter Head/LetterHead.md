 - Pressure treated wood was not used at the sill plates of the newly framed walls.
	 - **Code:** *2304.12.1.4 Sleepers and Sills Sleepers and sills on a concrete or masonry slab that is in direct contact with earth shall be of naturally durable or preservative treated wood.*
 - There was a stud directly in front of a plumbing cleanout.
	 - **Code:** 708.1.10.1 *Cleanout Plug Trim Covers Trim covers and access doors for cleanout plugs shall be designed for such purposes and shall be approved. Trim cover fasteners that thread into cleanout plugs shall be corrosion resistant. Cleanout plugs shall not be covered with mortar, plaster or any other permanent material.*
 - In a few locations, the spacing of some of the studs was greater than 24"
